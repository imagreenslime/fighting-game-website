Simple 1v1 Fighting Game

Description: 
A simple 1v1 fighting game made in a javascript canvas. Made in a Flask backend, it incorporates javascript class objects to create animated sprites. Each sprite runs on its own tickrate to flip through its images to appear as if it was being animated. There are two players, the control for the first player: AWSD for movement and F for attack. For the second player: JIKL and ; for attack. Once the healthbar reaches 0, the game is over.
